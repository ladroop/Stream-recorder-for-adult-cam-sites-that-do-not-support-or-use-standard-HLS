# Stream-recorder-for-adult-cam-sites-that-do-not-support-or-use-standard-HLS
 Record stripchat, livejasmin and many other cam sites that do not full support HLS/m3u8


 A userscript that adds a record button to adult webcam sites that do not support HLS or use non standard HLS

it works on:

www.stripchat.com
www.manyvids.com
www.livejasmin.com
www.xcams.com
www.secretfriends.com
www.soulcams.com
www.cameraprive.com
www.showup.tv

after ~6 seconds a little panel will occur with stop/record and preview
Just click the rec button to start recording and click again to pauze and stop to save it to disk.
With a mouse pull you can move the little panel to an other place.
If you right click the preview video you can go full screen, picture in picture and make a snapshot.
Use picture in picture if you are recording and go to an other tab (else the site may fall back to a lower resolution).
If you have no sound and you can not unmute it in the main video then click the mute icon in the preview. (only infefox, it's a firefox bug).
After that the audio in the main video will work again

Manyvids does not record sound. (blame manyvids)

it's a userscript so you need a userscript manager, i made it with tampermonkey
